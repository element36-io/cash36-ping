To try this example locally, do: 

```
truffle build
npm truffle migrate
npm run dev
```

Play with app.js and MyPing.sol and do a truffle migrate to deploy your MyPing Contract. 
The app.js can connect to an existing Ping (not MyPing) contract - so you dont have to set up a
local blockchain - see line 4 and 5 of app.js.
